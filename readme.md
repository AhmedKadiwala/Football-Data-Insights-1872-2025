# Sports Match Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of football match results to uncover trends and insights over time. The analysis emphasizes competitive matches, excluding friendlies, and includes detailed visualizations of goals scored across different years.

## Key Analyses Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset, handling date parsing and formatting inconsistencies.  
   - Ensured proper handling of non-competitive matches by excluding friendlies.  

2. **Goal Trends Analysis:**  
   - Computed and visualized total goals scored per year for competitive matches in the 21st century.  
   - Annotated key data points on the graph with dynamic positioning to avoid overlaps.  

3. **Home vs Away Goals Analysis:**  
   - Plotted a comparative line graph of home and away goals per year, using flexible point annotations for better readability.  
   - Highlighted yearly patterns in goal distribution.
